## <a name="goals" /> 1. Project Goals
This ***primary goal*** of this project is to develop a web-based **Dividend Stock Portfolio** which allows building a portfolio of dividend stocks, performs analysis of the positions, displays a roll-up of the portfolio data, and includes a table with position details.

The ***secondary goal*** is to learn the development steps and technology needed to deploy a functional Python WEB Application.

> [!NOTE]
> You may use the deployed WEB site (see [Getting Started](#getting-started))<br>
> You may clone this as a starting point for your own application.<br>
> You may also wish to review the [Development Steps](#development-steps) to aid with developing your own application.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is a ***work in progress*** so if you like where this is heading then be sure to check back later.<br>
> While under active development, the code may change frequently and the web application may be "broken" temporarily as features are developed.
